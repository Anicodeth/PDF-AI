“Inclusive culture encompasses both formal and informal policies and practices, and involves several core values such as: 
- Representation: (The presence of people with disabilities across a range of membership and leadership within the community and given institution); 
- Receptivity: (Respect for differences); 
- Fairness: (Equitable access to all resources, opportunities, networks and decision-making processes).”
